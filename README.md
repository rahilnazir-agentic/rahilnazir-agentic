# 👋 Hi, I'm Rahil  

AI Builder & Founder — crafting production-grade **AI Agents** and tools that solve real business problems.

I focus on building **hands-on AI Agents** and frameworks that blend automation, data, and design — helping teams move from prototype to production faster.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- 🤖 **AI Agents:** single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, browser agents, voice agents, and local agents  
- 🔧 **Dev workflows:** SPARC framework, structuring agents, handling tools, logs, eval, and planning  
- 🗂️ **RAG setups:** simple chains → agentic RAG → hybrid search → local RAG  
- 🚀 **Fine-tuning:** Llama, Gemma, and other open-source models  
- 🧩 **Code-first courses:** building with Agent Development Kit and OpenAI SDK, [Swarm-agentic-dev](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow), [SPARC Framework](https://gist.github.com/ruvnet/27ee9b1dc01eec69bc270e2861aa2c05)

- 🔍 **EVALs** — Why every AI app needs [EVAL](https://agenticedge.io/why-every-ai-app-needs-eval).  A framework for testing and benchmarking **AI Agent performance** across accuracy, reliability, and contextual reasoning.

## 📚 About Me
- AI Builder, Founder, CTO of multiple AI-first startups — **Thriftify, PRDGPT** — where we build agents that automate, learn, and ship.  
Before AI, I spent 16+ years building digital commerce for global brands, delivering over **$$$$$$+ in online revenue**.  

- I now write and teach at [AgenticEdge.io](https://agenticedge.io) — practical frameworks and insights for building **production-grade AI Agents**.

- 🌱 Building what's next in AI Agents, RAG, or LLMs? I'd love to chat and share input. Angel investing in the early-stage AI Agent startups

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- 🪟 Still partial to **Windows shortcuts** — muscle memory from a decade of building on it.  
- ⚔️ Love **strategy games** (Age of Empires, Civilization, Command & Conquer) — they taught me systems thinking before I knew the term.  
- 📼 Proud **90s kid** who still believes the best tech era started with dial-up tones and MSN Messenger.
